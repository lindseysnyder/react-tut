# react-tut

This code creates a tic-tac-toe game, with a "time travel" feature built in that lets players jump back to any previous move.

It is not my own; it comes directly from the [Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) tutorial offered on [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/). 

I followed along step by step and typed in the changes for hands-on practice.

**The tutorial offers practice in**
- React JS and component-based development
- React.Component subclasses
- JSX
- Custom React components
- Function components
- State management
- Lifting state to a parent and passing to controlled child components
- Benefits of immutability
- Component keys
- React DevTools
